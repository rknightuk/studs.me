This month Lego [gave the Christmas Train as a free gift](http://brickset.com/article/17271/[uk-eu-au-nz]-free-christmas-train-at-shop-lego-com) with purchases over £50 and this reminded me that I want to build the Christmas tree from [the Toy Shop](http://brickset.com/sets/10249-1/Toy-Shop). I downloaded [the instructions](http://cache.lego.com/bigdownloads/buildinginstructions/6127605.pdf) and built the christmas tree and ladder in Lego Digital Designer.

There are a couple of issue with the digital designer file:

1. The [string with knobs](http://brickset.com/parts/6096958) isn't in LDD in black so I've used white.
2. LDD doesn't have the [round plate with knob](http://brickset.com/parts/6102360) at all.

I have also put together the parts list (with the above errors fixed) in Bricklink XML format for easy importing into a wanted list. The only reasonably rare part in the build is the [reddish-brown ladder](http://brickset.com/parts/6079814).
