The Amazing Spider-Man 2 [Electro polybag (5002125)](http://brickset.com/sets/5002125-1/Electro) has been [found in Toys R Us by Reddit user iCANhazRECON](http://www.reddit.com/r/lego/comments/34qyzl/i_feel_bad_for_those_who_spent_100_on_their/). The polybag was [given away at Kidsfest](http://brickset.com/article/12615/amazing-spider-man-2-electro-polybag-found) in October last year and since then there has been no information about if this would be available elsewhere.

This always felt like a hole in my Marvel collection so I'm glad it's now available to the general public. I've ordered one from the US for a much more reasonable price than the $100 or more they have been going for on eBay for the last few months.
