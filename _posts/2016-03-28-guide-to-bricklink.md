Having only started using Bricklink a year or so ago, I remember how hard it was to find clear instructions on how to actually use the site. There are regularly posts on [/r/lego](https://www.reddit.com/r/lego) asking how to do various different things on Bricklink and people try to help for specific problems, but there is no central place to find all of this help in one place. So I created Guide to Bricklink.

The site aims to cover [all the main things](http://guidetobricklink.com/guides) a normal user might want to do on Bricklink from understanding [how the site works](http://guidetobricklink.com/how-bricklink-works), to [finding a store with the most parts based on a wanted list](http://guidetobricklink.com/buy-parts-from-a-wanted-list).
