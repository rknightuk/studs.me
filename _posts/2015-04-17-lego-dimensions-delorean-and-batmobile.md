Reddit user [cakeinmilk](http://www.reddit.com/user/cakeinmilk) has [posted LDD files](http://www.cakeinmilk.com/post/116580063366/i-took-the-best-parts-of-the-lego-dimensions-sets) for the LEGO Dimensions Batmobile from the [starter pack](http://brickset.com/sets/71173-1/Starter-Pack-Xbox-360) and the DeLorean from the [Back to the Future Level Pack](http://brickset.com/sets/71201-1/Level-Pack-Back-To-The-Future). These micro builds looks like a lot of fun and I'm glad I can build these before the [September release](http://brickset.com/article/14998/lego-dimensions-more-details-revealed) of the game.
