Many [Ultimate Collector's Sets](http://lego.wikia.com/wiki/Ultimate_Collector's_Series) come with a plaque with details about the model. Those that don't, like [the Batmobile](http://brickset.com/sets/7784-1/The-Batmobile-Ultimate-Collectors-Edition), can look out of place next to their [plaque-owning counterparts](http://brickset.com/sets/76023-1/The-Tumbler).

After some research into how I could design and print my own plaque for the Batmobile, I found [Stick 2 Quality](http://stores.ebay.co.uk/STICK-2-QUALITY-ZACPARIS?_trksid=p2047675.l2563) on eBay. Stick 2 Quality is an Australian company that sell replacement and replica stickers for use with Lego, including a [UCS-style sticker for the Batmobile](http://www.ebay.co.uk/itm/CUSTOM-DIE-CUT-UCS-STYLE-PLAQUE-STICKER-7784-BATMOBILE-BOOM-/141868354283?hash=item2108034aeb). I also ordered the [Batpod sticker](http://www.ebay.co.uk/itm/CUSTOM-BATMAN-PLAQUE-STICKER-BATPOD-MODELS-TOYS-5004590-76023-ETC-/141835544626?hash=item21060ea832).

Although Stick 2 Quality are based in Australia, postage is reasonable and the stickers arrived within a week of ordering. I can highly recommend these for anyone looking for replacement or replica stickers.
