The Lego Movie logo in [this MOC](https://www.flickr.com/photos/40949197@N00/sets/72157645315536417) by Lucifer Adams is fantastic and the best real-life representation of the logo I’ve seen. I recreated it in Lego Digital Designer while I consider ordering the parts for it (just over 600). Right now the individual LEGO letters aren’t joined together — I’m planning on using a couple of baseplates across the bottom but I’ve left these out of the LDD file.
